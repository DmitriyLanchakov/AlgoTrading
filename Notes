Wasn't able to use zipline with anaconda 3.5 

1) So followed the ljw2602 comment from 
https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/issues/650#issuecomment-167050802

Install Anaconda with Python 3.5
Since zipline is compatible with Python 3.4, you need to create an environment with Python 3.4
I named the environment "py34" here
$conda create -n py34 python=3.4 anaconda
Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express
This is what Python 3.4 is compatible with (http://microsoft-visual-cpp-express.soft32.com/)
Activate the environment & install zipline
$activate py34
$pip install -e C:\GitHub\zipline

To create a new python 3.4 env to install zipline

2) Then reinstalled using conda instead of pip to get the dependencies properly installed.

3) Had some issues, so I reinstalled bottleneck and upgraded numpy.

"from zipline.examples import buyapple"  - is still throwing an error
